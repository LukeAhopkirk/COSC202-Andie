Multilingual support (not completed)

Tests:
The code was tested by Jasper and all the test files are named ___Test.java
We also had someone who isn't really computer savy and tell them to try to break the program, this worked great
and we fixed alot of the problems which went over our head.

Description:
Andie is a software which allows for non destructive image editing, this means that all the changes are saved
in a seperate file that keeps all the changes done to it. This means the original image is not permanantly
changed. There are several features to this program all within seperate tabs to manipulate the image. 
The program has been throughly tested to avoid any error or possiblility of misinputs by the user.

Issues:
There are some issues along the way of developing ANDIE, most notably in our team. We haven't been able to
contact Jacob at all and he hasn't contributed anything to it. Aiden unenrolled from the university
but didn't tell us until one week till due date. It was really bad timing as Aiden's tasks were multilingual
support and unit testing, therefore we had to rush the last parts. Unfortunately we hadn't quite been able to
finish multilingual support, the problem with that is the user needs to restart the program everytime they
want to switch a language. On the other hand, we managed to complete unit testing, but it is a bit rushed.
