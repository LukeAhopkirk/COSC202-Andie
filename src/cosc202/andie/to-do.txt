Part one requirements:

COMPLETED (Richard) - Image resize
COMPLETED (Luke)Image rotations: 90◦, left; 90◦, right; 180◦
COMPLETED (Richard) - Image flip: Horizontal; Vertical


COMPLETED (Richard) - Brightness adjustment
COMPLETED (Richard) - Contrast adjustment


COMPLETED (Richard) - Image export
Multilingual support - WORKING ON (Aidan)


COMPLETED (Jasper) - Sharpen filter
COMPLETED (Jasper) - Gaussian blur filter
COMPLETED (Jasper) - Median filter


Exception handling (Jasper)
Other error avoidance/prevention (Jasper/Luke/Richard)
Examples:
- If user opens another image, pop up says to save current picture (Luke)
- If user tries to open non-image file, an error message pops up (Jasper)
- Inputs (kernelsize, multiplier) for Resize, MedianFilter, Contrast, Brightness, GaussianBlur throw 
IllegalArgumentException if out of bounds e.g. Below zero / not within -100 to 100. (Jasper)
- Sliders have been added for UI ease as well as error handling, user cannot entire inputs
outisde a certain range. (Jasper)
- Program quitting when saving/saveAsing/exporting an empty image (Richard)

Unit Tests (Jasper)
- Tests have been done for Brightness, Contrast, Resize and ImagePanel
- Checks that exceptions are thrown for out of bounds inputs, constructors work as expected,
null image files throw a NullPointerException, default values are consistent etc.

Filters with negative results (Jasper)
Emboss and edge detection filters (Jasper)
