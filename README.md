## Tests:
The code was tested by Jasper and all the test files are named ___Test.java. Tests have been done for Brightness, Contrast, Resize and ImagePanel. Examples include checking that exceptions are thrown for out of bounds inputs, constructors work as expected, null image files throw a NullPointerException, default values are consistent etc. We also had someone who isn't really computer savy and tell them to try to break the program, this worked great and we fixed alot of the problems which went over our head.

## Description:
Andie is a software which allows for non destructive image editing, this means that all the changes are saved in a seperate file that keeps all the changes done to it. This means the original image is not permanantly changed. There are several features to this program all within seperate tabs to manipulate the image. The program has been throughly tested to avoid any error or possiblility of misinputs by the user.

## Issues:
There are some issues along the way of developing ANDIE, most notably in our team. We haven't been able to contact Jacob at all and he hasn't contributed anything to it. Aiden unenrolled from the university but didn't tell us until one week till due date. It was really bad timing as Aiden's tasks were multilingual support and unit testing, therefore we had to rush the last parts. Unfortunately we hadn't quite been able to finish multilingual support, the problem with that is the user needs to restart the program everytime they
want to switch a language. On the other hand, we managed to complete unit testing, but it is a bit rushed.

Richard also got sick a few times which ment we werent able to catch up in person to show off unfinished code. To combat this we made sure to communicate often on a group chat and in meetings aswell as sharing our unfinished code with each other in order to try our best to get things done sooner. However I belive this could have particularly helped with mouse selection in particular as Luke struggled with it and bouncing ideas of another person in person would have helped a lot with getting this to work sooner. As Luke often had code that was close to working however not the way we wanted it to. This could have left us with more time to test. When we did get to meet up in person however we made sure to make the most of it by getting the most critical problems people were struggling with fixed first.
